      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Football legend Diego Maradona has been buried in a private ceremony after a day of emotional scenes in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires. Only around two dozen relatives and close friends attended the final ceremony on Thursday. But earlier huge crowds turned out to pay their respects, with many weeping, blowing kisses and praying as they filed past his coffin. Maradona died of a heart attack on Wednesday aged 60. His death triggered mourning around the world but nowhere was it felt more fiercely than in a country that saw him as a national hero. Maradona's coffin - draped in Argentina's national flag and football shirt, bearing his trademark number 10 on the back - was on public display at the presidential palace on Thursday. By mid-afternoon queues stretched back for more than a kilometre, and police clashed with mourners as they tried to close off the palace in anticipation of the wake scheduled for 16:00 local time (19:00 GMT). There were reports of tear gas and rubber bullets being used as officers in riot gear struggled to hold back the crowd.

        <h1>A love-hate relationship</h1>

        Reflecting this past week on the three-year anniversary of his move, the striker wrote that "(these) came with a lot of knowledge. I've lived times of joy and some complicated ones."
        His bond with supporters in the city of love has undulated its way through the full gamut of Facebook relationship statuses: From 'Married' to 'Separated' to 'It's complicated.'
        All with the allure of a former lover in Catalonia lingering in the background.
        A long drawn-out, but ultimately unsuccessful, serenade last summer to woo the Brazilian back to the Camp Nou brought simmering tensions in Paris to the boil.
        The love-hate dynamic around the polarizing figure was perhaps best encapsulated in the superstar's first league appearance of the 2019-20 season.
        Relentlessly booed for 90 minutes before delivering a sublime match-winning bicycle kick at the very death -- half the naysayers enraptured; the other half enraged.
        Kall√°s paints a picture of jury similarly split down the middle along generational lines in Brazil -- the young pretenders who adore "the image, the smile, the tattoos" contrasted with the old guard who are "really concerned about him."
        The Cold War in Paris has since thawed, along with the realization that going back to the future is -- for now -- not an imminent prospect.
        "He has shown on the pitch and off it that he's committed to the project [...] He really has to embrace the challenge of being a PSG player and achieving something, notably in the Champions League, in Paris," says Johnson.
        Whilst a new leaf may have been turned on the pitch, questions remain off it.
